## 💾 Data Storage

### How It Works
- All data stored in browser localStorage
- Key prefix: `sentient_team_`
- Each team member has own comment array
- Data persists across sessions
- No server communication

### Data Structure
```typescript
// localStorage key: sentient_team_{memberId}
[
  {
    id: "timestamp-random",
    xHandle: "@username",
    message: "Great work!",
    timestamp: 1234567890
  }
]
```

### Data Limits
- localStorage limit: ~5-10MB per domain
- Supports ~1000+ comments per member
- No automatic cleanup

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ No data sent to servers
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ No cookies

| Mobile (< 768px) | 1 column | ✅ Optimized |
