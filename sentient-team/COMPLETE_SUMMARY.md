## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Logo Now Showing
**Problem:** Logo path was `/logo.png` but file was `/logo.jpg`
**Solution:** Changed path to `/logo.jpg`
**Result:** Logo now displays at top of page

### 2. ✅ Team Orbs Now Centered
**Problem:** Orbs were left-aligned in grid cells
**Solution:** Added `flex justify-center items-start` to grid items
**Result:** All orbs perfectly centered on all screen sizes

### 3. ✅ Percentage Fixed
**Problem:** 1 comment = 10% (should be 1%)
**Solution:** Changed formula from `(count/10)*100` to `count`
**Result:** 1 comment = 1%, max 100% at 100 comments

### 4. ✅ Footer Updated
**Problem:** Footer didn't mention your name
**Solution:** Added "Built with ❤️ by Panchu"
**Result:** Your name now displayed in footer

### 5. ✅ Global Comments Ready
**Problem:** Comments only stored locally, not visible to others
**Solution:** Integrated Supabase for global database
**Result:** Comments visible to everyone, real-time updates
