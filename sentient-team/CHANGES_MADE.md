# ✅ Changes Made - Summary

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Team Orbs Centering
**Problem:** Team orbs were not centered in their grid cells
**Solution:** Added `flex justify-center` wrapper to each grid item
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (line 107)

**Before:**
```jsx
<motion.div key={member.id} variants={itemVariants}>
  <TeamOrb member={member} index={index} />
</motion.div>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<motion.div key={member.id} variants={itemVariants} className="flex justify-center">
  <TeamOrb member={member} index={index} />
</motion.div>
```

**Result:** All team orbs are now perfectly centered in their grid cells on all screen sizes!

### 2. ✅ Logo Added to Hero Section
**Problem:** No logo displayed on the page
**Solution:** Added logo image at the top of hero section
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 40-50)

**Added:**
```jsx
{/* Logo */}
<motion.div
  variants={itemVariants}
  className="mb-8"
>
  <img
    src="/logo.png"
    alt="Sentient Logo"
    className="h-16 md:h-20 w-auto mx-auto"
  />
</motion.div>
```

**Result:** Logo now appears at the top of the page with proper sizing and animation!
