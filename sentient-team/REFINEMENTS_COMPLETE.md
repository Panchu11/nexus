# ✨ Phase 1 Refinements - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 All Requested Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Custom Background Image for Cards

**Where to Place:**
- File name: `card-bg.jpg` (or `.png`)
- Location: `public/` folder
- Recommended size: 600x400px or larger

**How It Works:**
1. Place your image in `public/card-bg.jpg`
2. When you generate a card, it automatically uses this background
3. A dark overlay (60% opacity) is applied for text readability
4. The card is converted to PNG

**Example:**
```
sentient-team/
├── public/
│   ├── logo.jpg
│   ├── card-bg.jpg  ← Add your image here
│   └── favicon.ico
```

### ✅ 2. Share to X on Cards

**Features:**
- New "Share on X" button on generated cards
- Opens X in a separate tab
- Pre-fills with:
  - Team member name
  - Appreciation message
  - Hashtags (#SentientAGI #Appreciation)
  - Link to app

**Button Location:**
- In the card generation modal
- Cyan-colored button for consistency
- Between Download and Share buttons

**Example X Post:**
```
I appreciate [Member Name] for: "[Message]"

🌟 Check out the Sentient Team Appreciation Board!
