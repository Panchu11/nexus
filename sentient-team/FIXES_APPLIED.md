# ✅ All Fixes Applied!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Logo Now Showing
**Issue:** Logo path was `/logo.png` but file was `/logo.jpg`
**Fix:** Changed path to `/logo.jpg`
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (line 53)

### 2. ✅ Team Orbs Now Centered
**Issue:** Orbs were not centered in grid cells
**Fix:** Added `flex justify-center items-start` to grid items
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 106-124)

### 3. ✅ Percentage Calculation Fixed
**Issue:** 1 comment = 10%, should be 1 comment = 1%
**Fix:** Changed formula from `(count / 10) * 100` to just `count`
**File:** `src/utils/storage.ts` (line 48)

### 4. ✅ Footer Updated with Your Name
**Issue:** Footer didn't mention your name
**Fix:** Added "Built with ❤️ by Panchu"
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx` (line 134)

### 5. ✅ Global Comments Storage (Supabase)
**Issue:** Comments only stored locally, not visible to others
**Fix:** Integrated Supabase for global database
**Files:** 
- Created `src/utils/database.ts` (new)
- Updated `src/components/OrbModal.tsx`
- Updated `src/components/TeamOrb.tsx`
